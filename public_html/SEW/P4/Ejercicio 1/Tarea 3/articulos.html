<h3>Resumen: </h3>
<p>On December 20 of 2012 Sandra García Rodríguez defended his PhD at Carlos III of Madrid (Spain), called: 
		“Application of Multiobjective Techniques for Robust Portfolio Optimization”. This thesis was supervised by Dr. David Quintana 
		Montero and Dr. Inés M. Galván León. The defense was done in a publicly open presentation held at Carlos III University of Madrid. 
		The PhD was approved, with the highest rating Cum Laude, by the examining committee: Dr. José Manuel Molina López,	Dr. Antonio 
		Gaspar Lopes da Cunha and Dr. David Camacho Fernández.</p>

<h3>Resumen: </h3>
<p>TIn the Persian language, an Ezafe construction is a linking element which joins the head of a phrase to its modifiers. 
		The Ezafe in its simplest form is pronounced as –e, but generally not indicated in writing. Determining the position of an Ezafe is 
		advantageous for disambiguating the boundary of the syntactic phrases which is a fundamental task in most natural language 
		processing applications. This paper introduces a framework for combining genetic algorithms with rule-based models that brings 
		the advantages of both approaches and overcomes their problems. This framework was used for recognizing the position of Ezafe 
		constructions in Persian written texts. At the first stage, the rule-based model was applied to tag some tokens of an input sentence. 
		Then, in the second stage, the search capabilities of the genetic algorithm were used to assign the Ezafe tag to untagged tokens using 
		the previously captured training information. The proposed framework was evaluated on Peykareh corpus and it achieved 95.26 percent 
		accuracy. Test results show that this proposed approach outperformed other approaches for recognizing the position of Ezafe constructions.</p>

<h3>Resumen: </h3>
<p>This paper motivates, presents and demonstrates in use a methodology based in complex network analysis 
		to support research aimed at identification of sources in the process of knowledge transfer at the interorganizational level. 
		The importance of this methodology is that it states a unified model to reveal knowledge sharing patterns and to compare 
		results from multiple researches on data from different periods of time and different sectors of the economy. This methodology 
		does not address the underlying statistical processes. To do this, national statistics departments (NSD) provide documents and 
		tools at their websites. But this proposal provides a guide to model information inferences gathered from data processing revealing 
		links between sources and recipients of knowledge being transferred and that the recipient detects as main source to new knowledge 
		creation. Some national statistics departments set as objective for these surveys the characterization of innovation dynamics in firms and 
		to analyze the use of public support instruments. From this characterization scholars conduct different researches. Measures of dimensions 
		of the network composed by manufacturing firms and other organizations conform the base to inquiry the structure that emerges from taking 
		ideas from other organizations to incept innovations. These two sets of data are actors of a two- mode-network. The link between two actors 
		(network nodes, one acting as the source of the idea. The second one acting as the destination) comes from organizations or events organized 
		by organizations that “provide” ideas to other group of firms. The resulting demonstrated design satisfies the objective of being a methodological 
		model to identify sources in knowledge transfer of knowledge effectively used in innovation.</p>

<h3>Resumen: </h3>
<p>Big Data offers opportunities in many fields. Healthcare is not an exception. In this paper we summarize the possibilities 
		of Big Data and Big Data technologies to offer useful information to policy makers. In a world with tight public budgets and ageing 
		populations we feel necessary to save costs in any production process. The use of outcomes from Big Data could be in the future a 
		way to improve decisions at a lower cost than today. In addition to list the advantages of properly using data and technologies from
		Big Data, we also show some challenges and risks that analysts could face. We also present an hypothetical example of the use of 
		administrative records with health information both for diagnoses and patients.</p>
