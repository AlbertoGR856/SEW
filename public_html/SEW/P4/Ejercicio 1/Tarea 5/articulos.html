<h3>Resumen: </h3>
<p>TIn the Persian language, an Ezafe construction is a linking element which joins the head of a phrase to its modifiers. 
		The Ezafe in its simplest form is pronounced as –e, but generally not indicated in writing. Determining the position of an Ezafe is 
		advantageous for disambiguating the boundary of the syntactic phrases which is a fundamental task in most natural language 
		processing applications. This paper introduces a framework for combining genetic algorithms with rule-based models that brings 
		the advantages of both approaches and overcomes their problems. This framework was used for recognizing the position of Ezafe 
		constructions in Persian written texts. At the first stage, the rule-based model was applied to tag some tokens of an input sentence. 
		Then, in the second stage, the search capabilities of the genetic algorithm were used to assign the Ezafe tag to untagged tokens using 
		the previously captured training information. The proposed framework was evaluated on Peykareh corpus and it achieved 95.26 percent 
		accuracy. Test results show that this proposed approach outperformed other approaches for recognizing the position of Ezafe constructions.</p>
